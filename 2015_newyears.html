I have to pay attention to her, and do what she wants me to. She has been sitting on her phone for an hour, though. It should be fine if I play on my phone, too. I have been on my phone for a few minutes before she looks over and notices. Sitting up to reach over and take my phone away from me. She doesn’t say anything. I sit for a few more minutes before reaching over for my laptop. She notices. Before I can even start my laptop she grabs it away from me, and tells me I am not paying enough attention to her before going back to playing on her phone. I sit there. Staring off into space. I am not allowed to do anything. She puts her phone down and picks up mine, I have to keep her updated on what my passcode is, so she just unlocks my phone. She scrolls around a bit on my phone before using my phone to group video call our friends on my phone. I am still sitting there. No one tries to talk to me. No one asks where I am. They know she called from my phone. They know she is spending the night at my house. I sit there silently, doing nothing. I sit there for hours, staring off into space listening while they talk, joke and laugh with each other. No one cares if I am there. It’s a few hours before they all say goodbye. She says she wants to go to bed. I can’t feel anything, not even my body. She sleeps on the bed like she always does. I sleep on the floor like I always do. I can’t feel anything. No one cares. I am 15.  </p>
