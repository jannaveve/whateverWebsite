Even inseparable from the girl who lived down the street. Then a new girl moved into the neighborhood. She put up with me for maybe a month, but she told everyone she didn’t like me, that I was mean and that if anyone continued to be friends with me she would stop being friends with them. Now no one will talk to me. No one will sit with me on the bus. Kids will chase me home, come into my backyard to make fun of me and the girl down the street won’t even acknowledge I exist when she comes to stay at my house after school. Waiting for her parents to get home. My parents called her parents to tell them she can’t stay at our house after school anymore. I don’t go play outside anymore either. I am sad all the time and I don’t know why. I feel alone. I am 9.   </p>
