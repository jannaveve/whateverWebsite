Class is over but students are released in shifts. First it's early bus students, then everyone else. We are all part of the second release. While we wait to be released we stand in the back of class chatting. I don't know when they moved but my friends are standing around me in a circle, the teacher wouldn't be able to see around them. I don't think about it until 9353 starts to grab my ass, but this time he doesn't let go. I feel cold and sick. I laugh along like I normally do hoping he'll stop. Today he doesn't. He starts to squeeze down hard. It hurts and I try to move away but I am boxed in. I feel like I'm going to throw up. Our release is called. He lets go and they start to disperse. They are laughing amongst themselves. I wait until they are all ahead of me to leave. I have learned that it's smarter to walk behind them. I am 13. </p>
