It isn't something I have thought about before. Recently though, I made some gay friends and the more I talk with them the more I realize I am not heterosexual. 64554 is realizing the same. We are close friends so we talk about it often. One day 64554 asks me if I am attracted to her. I tell her I think she is attractive. She asks if I would have sex with her. I told her that I wasn't sure I wanted to do that. She gets mad at me. She keeps asking. She says that if I was a good friend I would do sexual things with her. I don't want to but I don't want to lose more friends. I feel like I don't have a choice. I am 13. </p>
