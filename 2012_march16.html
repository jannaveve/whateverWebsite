We are laying down in my room, my puppy between us. She leans over and grabs me roughly by the nose telling me that I am hogging my dog. I think she is joking around so I reach over and grab her nose. She starts doing it harder. I want her off, so I push at her. Everything moves, I am over where she was laying and I don't know how I got here, but her hands are on my neck. She looks mad. She has never looked like this before, she has never choked me this hard before. I am not sure how I get her off but she slams against my wall. She glares at me before running out and locking herself in another room. My mom calls her mom to come pick her up. She isn't allowed at our house anymore. However, my birthday is coming up and I want to have a party. This creates problems. She finds out she isn't invited. I am waiting for my parents to pick me up after school, sitting on a bench out front. She approaches me with a friends and demands to know why she can't come to my party. I tell her she isn't allowed at my house anymore. She does not believe me. She charges at me. I run. I try to get back inside the school but the doors are locked. I am trapped. She shoves my back against the door and punches me in the stomach before slamming my head into the door. Her mom pulls up to pick her up. She leaves me there. My mom calls her mom that night, but her mom doesn't believe that she did it. My mom wants to call my school but I won't let her. I don't want to make it worse. I don't feel safe. I am 12. </p>
