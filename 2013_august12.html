So does my mom, but my dad feels like we have to go so we do. It always ends up the same way, though. No one talks to me. I get the how are you question is greeting but that’s it. We already ate so there isn’t anything for me to do. Other kids are off playing, but they don’t seem to like me. My cousins are off playing with them or riding their bikes, there isn’t enough for everyone so I am stuck. I can’t even play on my phone without someone making some smart remark. So, I am just sitting here. Waiting for my mom to finish making her rounds. We are the only people we interact with while here. It’s always been like this. I don’t feel like my family cares that I exist. I am 13.  </p>
