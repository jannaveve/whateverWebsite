It’s his birthday. We have been playing outside in the sprinklers and I was excited about wearing my new bikini top. Somehow, my top gets unclipped. I ask a friend I am comfortable with to come with me to the bathroom and help me fix it. We do not lock the door. We did not think we would need to. Him and two of his friends start trying to break into the bathroom. They wanted to see me with my top off. We fight to get them out of the bathroom. Holding the door shut, as they fight to get back inside. In the struggle, we manage to lock the door. Once my top is fixed, we go back out to the party. I don't know that what happened isn't okay, until I get home and tell my mom. She is horrified. I am 7.  </p>
