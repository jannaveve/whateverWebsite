I try to smack it off the top of is head. He starts moving away from me, but I follow him. He tells me to stop. I say okay but mock trying to hit it off again. He grabs me by the throat and pins me down on top of a table. He lets go and storms off. Everyone is staring at me. I am embarrased. I don't tell a teacher. Someone else did, though. I get pulled out of class, and the teacher asks me why I didn't tell someone. I tell them it's because I was embarrased. They tell me they aren't going to do anything about it because I didn't come forward to them. They tell me it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't been annoying him. I am 9. </p>
