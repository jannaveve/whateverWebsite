We have to take extra classes at 8am on a Saturday morning once a month, and it wasn't that expensive. My parents let me go. We are split up into groups to share rooms. I am roomed with 64554. We leave tomorrow but I can't sleep. My chest hurts. I want to scream. My skin itches. I got rid of my razors, I am trying to hold out but it's been hours. I look at my cork board. I have push pins. I need to sleep. I regret it when I wake up in the morning. I find my thinest sweater so I can cover my arms. It's too hot, though, once we get to Florida. When people notice I just tell them that I got in a fight with some thorns. It's the second day of the week long trip. My vice principal asks me to come with her. She asks me to sit on a bench with her. She asks and I tell her what I told everyone else. She tells me she knows I'm lying. I go silent. I start to cry. She rubs my back while I cry. When I am done she asks if I believe in god, and I tell her no. she then tells me that maybe I wouldn't do this to myself if I believed in god. As we walk back to the group she tells me when we get back from the trip she is telling my parents. I want to cry again. Maybe there is something wrong with me. That's all I can think about the rest of the trip. I am 14. </p>
