I try to avoid it as much as possible, but the longer I put it off the more upset she gets, the more I get punished. Tonight she is sleeping over. Nothing has happend. She is laying on my bed playing on her phone, I am laying on the floor. I have learned not to play on my phone too long, so I lay face down on a pillow. I am drifting half in and half out when she starts touching me. I freeze. She keeps going. I don't know how long it is before she pulls me on top of her and puts her leg between mine. She tells me to rub against her leg. I don't think about it, I just do what she says. She keeps touching me. My eyes have been closed and when I open them I wish I hadn't. She looks angry, disgusted and inconvenienced. I start saying I'm sorry over and over again. My entire body goes stiff. I have never had an orgasm before. I am shaking. She pushes me off of her and I roll onto the floor. I don't know how long I lay there before I get up to go to the bathroom. I can't look at myself in the mirror. When I get back I try to joke about how she made me cum. She makes fun of me because I can't get her to cum anymore. She says that I am not good enough at it. She thinks it's funny. I am not good enough to be raped. I am 14. </p>
