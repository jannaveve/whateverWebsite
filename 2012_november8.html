Today 5639, 287846, 9353 and me, got permission to go to the computer lab to work on homework. We are sitting over in the corner out of the general view of the teacher, I am sitting on the left end working on my homework when 9353 scoots over between 287846 and me to ask a question. He puts his hand on my thigh and I freeze. He scoots away and I try to laugh it off, like I do with the other stuff he does. He scoots back over to ask another question. He puts his hand on my thigh, but he doesn’t leave it there this time. He keeps moving it up. I am frozen, I don’t know what to do. He touches me through my jeans, my mind is blank. 5689 and 287846 are watching. They ask me if it makes me hot. I don’t know what that means. I don’t know how long it all stays frozen like that before the teacher calls over for us to start working on our own again. He scoots away. I don’t know what to do so I try to laugh it off. I don’t want to risk losing  more friends. I never tell anyone. I am 12. </p>
