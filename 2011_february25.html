We both have the same group of friends, and the same weekend we all went to go roller skating together. We had been at the skating rink for about an hour when he asks me if we can get back together. I tell him no. Half an hour later my friends come up to me, they tell me I need to get back together with 89537. I ask them why. He told them that he is going to kill himself. I ask if he is serious. They say he is asking other people there for weopons. I am scared. I go to the girls bathroom. My friends send in a mutual friend of ours to come and get me. I do not want to leave. They start calling me. Asking me to come and make him feel better. To reassure him we will be friends. I do not leave the bathroom. They start sending strangers into the bathroom with messages for me. Telling me I need to get back together with 89537, asking me to take care of this. They are waiting at the door of the bathroom. They have started harrassing our mutual friend. I am in the bathroom for 2 hours. I am too scared to leave. I call my mom, and ask her to get me early. She agrees to met me at the doors to the skating rink. My friend agrees to take my skates back for me and distract the rest of our friends so they will move away from the door. When my mom gets there she goes out to get them away from the door. I run for it. When I get in the car I tell my mom to just drive. I am crying. After I tell her what happened she takes me to get ice cream. That night 89537 texts me before I go to bed, telling me to have fun reading his obituary in the paper. I get back together with him. I am 11. </p>
