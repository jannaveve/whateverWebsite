I agreed to do sexual things with her. I try to tell myself that it's not a big deal. It's late when she brings it up, and I try to back out. I still don't want to do it. She starts to get mad. I ask her to give me a minute. I start texting as many friends as I can, looking for anyone to respond. 276339 responds. I tell him that I 64554 is asking me to do sexual things with her, that I am scared and that I don't know what to do. He asks me if this is something I want to do. I tell him no, but that 64554 wants me to do it and I feel like I have to. He doesn't respond for a few minutes. 64554 is getting impatient. He texts back okay, if she wants you to. He gives me advice on what to do sexually. It is the first time I get raped. I am 13. </p>
